          <p>
            This class generally has the best armor, and is the most skilled
            with the largest weapons. High HP, attack, and defense scores are a
            usually characteristic of the Fighter class. This class is usually
            utilized by players who favor a hack and slash style gameplay.

          <p>

            Mages usually wear the weakest of armor, many times clad in nothing
            but robes, but can also cast shield, healing, and regeneration
            spells. Mages also usually do their damage from long range, as
            opposed to close quarters, where theyâ€™re usually susceptible to
            damage.

          <h3>Bard</h3>
          <p>
            The defining characteristics of bards is the use of music or other
            artistic mediums to contribute to a fight. Bards can be supportive,
            offensive, defensive, or a jack-of-all-trades type of class. They
            often use their artistic talents to induce magical spells.
